# Destination Briefing

This project is part of the University of Minnesota Full Stack Web Development Curriculum and is a collabertive project.  The project tasked the team with creating an app with some base project requirements but the ***"WHAT"*** of the project was for the group to decide. 

## The Project:

We created an app that would gather valueable travel information that is spread out over many locations about a given country and present it to the user in one simple to navigate location. 

A user would simply search by entering the country name and the app would gather and populate desired travel information such as currency, language, water safety and other valueable travel information giving them a destination briefing.
